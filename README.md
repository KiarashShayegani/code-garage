## 🛠️ What is this exactly?

You know your dad's garage? The one with:
- A lawnmower that hasn't run since 2003
- 47 half-empty paint cans ("I'll use this someday")
- Tools you've never seen used
- A car that's been "under restoration" for 12 years
- Random screws in jars labeled "???"

**This is that garage. But for Python and SQL.**

I wrote these when I was probably reviewing, messing around to solve a problem without help of AI, or times when I felt like I'm in my genius mode, which didn't last long..

📁 sql/             # Queries that work on my machine™
📁 WTF/             # I have no idea about these
```

## 🤝 Bringing Friends?

Please don't. I'm embarrassed enough as it is.
